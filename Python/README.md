# Libraries Used in this Project
1. tkinter:
   This library is typically included with Python installations, so you don't need to install it separately.
   
3. PIL (Python Imaging Library): PIL is now maintained as Pillow, which is a fork of the original PIL library. You can install it using pip:
   
   pip install Pillow
   
6. qrcode: This library allows you to generate QR codes. You can install it using pip:
   
   pip install qrcode[pil]
   
The [pil] part is optional but recommended, as it installs the PIL (Pillow) dependency for qrcode to work with images.
